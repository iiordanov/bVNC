Pick one of I-a or I-b below, then move onto II.

Please note that while for now there is a reference to eclipse_projects
in the directory structure of the project, you no longer have to work
in Eclipse to develop bVNC.


I-a. Building bVNC with pre-built dependencies.
  - Set the environment variable PROJECT to one of bVNC, aSPICE, or aRDP.

    export PROJECT=bVNC && ./eclipse_projects/download-prebuilt-dependencies.sh && ./eclipse_projects/bVNC/copy_prebuilt_files.sh $PROJECT && ./eclipse_projects/bVNC/prepare_project.sh --skip-build $PROJECT nopath nopath


I-b. Building from scratch and working in Android Studio.

  - On Linux, install Android Studio, Android SDK, and Android NDK

  - Install at least the following dependencies on your Linux machine:
    cmake automake libtool intltool gtk-doc-tools gnome-common gobject-introspection nasm

  - To build bVNC, aSPICE, or aRDP

    - Set the environment variable PROJECT to one of bVNC, aSPICE, or aRDP.
      Set the environment variables ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK to your SDK and NDK respectively.

      export PROJECT=bVNC
      export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/your/android/NDK/
      export ANDROID_SDK=/path/to/your/android/SDK/

      export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_NDK}
      export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_SDK}/platform-tools/
      export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_SDK}/tools

    - Accept all licenses (repeat if you see an error during build)
      ${ANDROID_SDK}/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses

    - Then, run the build script. E.g.:

      ./eclipse_projects/bVNC/prepare_project.sh $PROJECT $ANDROID_NDK $ANDROID_SDK

    - Follow the instructions that the script outputs.


II. Importing projects into Android Studio should be as simple as selecting
  "Open an existing Android Studio project" on the Welcome screen, browsing
  to the remote-desktop-clients directory and selecting it.

  - One final tweak is necessary to the (external) freeRDPCore project before
    the project can build. Double-click "Gradle Scripts" on the left, and
    open build.gradle (Module freeRDPCore). Change minSdkVersion to 11.

  - Build -> Make Project should now work.
